### Arthur Goldman's patented space-age out-of-this-world moooooooon waffles

#### Dry ingredients:
* 175 ml all-purpose flour (175 ml is about .5 U.S. cups)
* .5 tsp baking powder
* .5 tsp vanilla sugar (vanilla sugar doesn't exist in the U.S., and I haven't seen vanilla extract in Sweden, so feel free to just use the same amount of vanilla extract in with the wet ingredients instead)
* .5 tsp salt
* 1 tbsp sugar

#### Wet ingredients:
* 175 ml buttermilk (if you don't have buttermilk, you can combine 150ml milk, preferably whole, and 25 ml vinegar and let sit for a few minutes)
* 1 egg yolk
* 1 tbsp canola oil or melted butter

#### What do I do with the rest of that egg from above?
* 1 egg white, beat to stiff peaks

#### Instructions:
Combine dry ingredients in a bowl and whisk until combined.
Combine wet ingredients in a different bowl and whisk until combined.
Combine wet and dry ingredients and whisk until smooth.
Fold in egg yolk.
Grab your waffle iron and fry 'em up!
Serve with butter and your choice of maple syrup or caramel sauce.
